	the original document. just like regular apps do.
-fix turn off spell check in the browser
-wire up toolbar buttons (Bold, Italic, Link, etc.) for WYSIWYG mode
-fix find/replace to work with WYSIWYG contenteditable
-need to move the horzontal scroll bar up a little bit so that it is not
  partially cut off at the bottom of the screen.
-the file buttons, edit buttons are too small.
-in teh help menu the expanded window is not adjusting to the sections properly and the right
  of the expanded view is off the screen to the right.
-change the font size and line height to arrow buttons instead of the slider
-implement side by side view of documents. editing a document is allowed
-add a button somewhere that will convert my shortcut syntax into 
  regular markdown syntax for using the document in other markdown apps
-swap the theme and tab menu buttons position in the view tab
-in addition to a scroll bar on the open tabs panel, i want to implement
  buttons. i never liked scroll bars on open tabs panel. maybe be applyLineNumbers
  to toggle between them for people that want one instead of the otehr.
  probrably add an option in the settings->Options
-the menu tabs, open on hover, needs to be removed from all menu tabs
  they should be open on click and close on click anywhere on the screeen
  that is not that tab (click anywere part is already implemented).
-the open file needs to go to the last directory and persist throough
  refresh. it does not need to persist through open/close of the app.
